#compute likelihood at each value in grid// binomial distribution function (how many correct, size = how many trials, what would be the probability of this data) <- gonna get probability for each possible rate of the correct answer
likelihood<- dbinom(6, size = 9, prob = p_grid)

#compute product of likelihood and prior
unstd.posterior<- likelihood*prior

#standardize the posterior, so it sums to 1

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
